<h3>Our story</h3>
</div>

<div class = "missionstatement">
<p>Beyond the Box aims to provide a safe, inclusive environment for individuals to explore issues regarding their racial and ethnic identities. Our anonymous forum is a facilitated discussion space where experiences and stories can be shared without risk of judgment or harassment. In doing so, we hope to educate and raise awareness of our generation’s struggles to accept and embrace their individuality. Particularly, we emphasize and destigmatize the insecurities surrounding a mixed-race identity. In the rapidly growing field of technology, where minorities and mixed-race individuals may feel out of place, we utilize not only our knowledge of computer science but our personal experiences to shape our community. ​</p>

    <p>
      Lauren Zaidel is a rising junior at Palisades Charter High School. She loves coding and STEM, and she’s interested in all things tech, especially web development! She’s passionate about making sure all voices are heard -  especially representing girls and diverse backgrounds in the field. Being of a multiracial background herself, she understands and has felt all the issues we aspire to destigmatize, leading her to bring Beyond the Box to fruition. Living in a world where she has to succumb to societal labels, she decided to define herself "beyond the box." She’d love to get to know you all and hear any concerns/questions about the forum :)
